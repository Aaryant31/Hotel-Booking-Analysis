EDA Hotel Booking Analysis

The hotel industry has a very peculiar set of booking arrangements with different distribution channels. we have performed data analysis at every level of the dataset to draw out key insights about the industry. we started this project on 22nd July 2021, we started brainstorming on the questions that we wanted to solve using our analysis. Each one of our team memberâ€™s analyses is provided separately in this document. We are grateful to Alma Better for giving us the opportunity to work on such an exciting project.
